# Steganography-Honors-Project
This is my undergrad capstone/honors project demonstrating LSB insertion steganography. It is intended to be used in a terminal and has no GUI. The LodePNG library (included) is required to run it. Runs on Linux.

The program can embed any file type into any PNG, given the PNG is large enough to hold it, and can pull out previously embedded files. For full details on the project, see manuscript.pdf.
